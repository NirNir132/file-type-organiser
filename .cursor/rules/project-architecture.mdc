# File Type Organizer Architecture Guidelines

This is a React-based file organizer and converter application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

- Main entry point: [index.html](mdc:index.html)
- Application root: [src/App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx)
- Components live in `src/components/`
- Utilities and helpers in `src/utils/`
- Type definitions in `src/types/`

## Core Features

1. **File Organization**: Sort and organize files by type, date, or custom rules
2. **File Conversion**: Convert between different file formats (Beta feature)
3. **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive file upload and management
4. **Real-time Processing**: Handle file operations without page refresh

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **File Handling**: Native File API and custom utilities

## Development Principles

1. Keep components modular and reusable
2. Use TypeScript for type safety throughout the application
3. Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
4. Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
5. Prioritize user experience with clear feedback and intuitive UI
